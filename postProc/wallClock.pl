# This scripts reads the start run time of the state one simulation
# and the end run time of the stage two simulation to calculate the
# total run time. 
# This Perl script reads a template notification text file located 
# (usually) in the postProc folder, and write wallclock time in it.
# Notification will be send as screen output, or an email specified
# by user in the config file. 
#
# usage:
# %perl wallClock.pl --st $STARTRUN --et $ENDRUN
