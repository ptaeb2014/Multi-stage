version history:

v.1   |  February 2018  |  One-way nesting, Hindcast Only, elevation specified boundary condition only, BC extracting from fort.63 generated by parent mesh simulation.
                           Using 900-sec time interval is recommended as BC supplying frequency to keep the parent mesh runtime efficient.
v1.1  |  March    2018  |  One-way nesting, Hindcast Only, elevation specified boundary condition only, BC obtained from fort.61 allowing for high BC supplying frequency.
                           This technique allows for using BC supplying frequency in the order of time step size of the parent mesh simulation (stage one) eliminating any possible 
                           inaccuracy associated with using low BC supplying frequency.
                           control_file_gen.pl and main.sh are modified.
